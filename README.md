# HttpBoard

A focused Angular project to explore **modern HTTP communication patterns** using Angular's HttpClient.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project is designed as a **learning and experimentation board** for handling HTTP requests in a real-world frontend application.

The main goal is to understand and control:
- Request lifecycles
- Error handling strategies
- Interceptors and cross-cutting concerns
- Cancellation and retry mechanisms

## 🌐 HTTP Concepts Covered

- Angular HttpClient (modern API)
- Functional HTTP interceptors
- Global error handling
- Request/response interception
- Retry strategies
- Request cancellation
- Typed DTO → domain mapping

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Angular (Standalone APIs)
- TypeScript
- Angular HttpClient
- RxJS

## 🧠 Key Learnings Demonstrated

- Centralized HTTP configuration using `provideHttpClient`
- Functional interceptors instead of class-based interceptors
- Clean separation between HTTP layer and domain logic
- Predictable error handling patterns
- Safer async flows using RxJS operators

## ▶️ Running the project

```bash
npm install
npm start
